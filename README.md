# RezStrafe_cpp-v7.0
UPD: Now we have 3rd window, this is console-window where can be shown some stats, like summary strafes count

Also we have new hotkeys:
  *F2 - Enable/disable summary strafes counting

Other keys still as before:
  *F1 - New autostrafing mode
  
  *Instert - Start autostrafing
  
  *Delete - Stop autostrafing

Also i've optimized code :)
